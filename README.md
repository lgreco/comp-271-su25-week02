# COMP 271 SU25 WEEK 02

This assignment has two parts: a coding part based on current material we discuss in class and a reflection part to evaluate work you have already submitted.


# Standing requirements

* **Programmers Pact:** Your work must be compliant with the [Programmers Pact](./ProgrammerPact.pdf). 
* **Comments:** Your code must be sufficiently documented with comments.
* **No imports:** You may not use the import statement in your code, with one exception: `import Arrays;` is allowed only for using `Arrays.toString()`. No other methods of class `Arrays` may be used.
* **Only `System.out` calls:** you may use `System.out` to print to the console. No other methods from `System` are allowed. Only `System.out.println`, `System.out.printf`, and `System.out.print`.
