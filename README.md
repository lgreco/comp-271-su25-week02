# COMP 271 SU25 WEEK 02

This assignment has two parts: a coding part based on current material we discuss in class and a reflection part to evaluate work you have already submitted.


# Standing requirements

* **Programmers Pact:** Your work must be compliant with the [Programmers Pact](./ProgrammerPact.pdf). 
* **Comments:** Your code must be sufficiently documented with comments.
* **No imports:** You may not use the import statement in your code, with one exception: `import Arrays;` is allowed only for using `Arrays.toString()`. No other methods of class `Arrays` may be used.
* **Only `System.out` calls:** you may use `System.out` to print to the console. No other methods from `System` are allowed. Only `System.out.println`, `System.out.printf`, and `System.out.print`. 
 

# Code

Study the code in class [MinHeap.java](./MinHeap.java) and implement its `heapifyUp()` method. Use class [MinHeap_Implement](./MinHeap_Implement.java) to test your code. 

There are six tests in `MinHeap_Implement`. You can run the program and you'll see all tests reporting a `fail`. Once you complete your `heapifyUp()` correctly, all six tests will report success.


# Reflect

Compare your code from the previous **two** assignment with Leo's posted solutions and discuss the following points.

* Was your code sufficiently documented with comments? (Commenting is a skill introduced in COMP 170 or similar course).

* Did you test your code to verify that it compiles and returns correct results?
